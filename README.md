-------------------------------------------

##CONTENTS:
 - Package-Diagram.pdf: xplanations Graphical representation and explanation of implementations and what they convey. 
 
 - Source Code: Contains all source and header files necessary for the program to function.

 - Executable: Contains executable to run application.

-------------------------------------------

##EXECUTABLE:
Build Instructions:
  Simply unzip the folder, open the 'Executable' folder and navigate to the "release" folder. Double click the executable 'grapefuit_exe' and the program will begin running. 
  
Notes:
 - Built on a Windows 10 Machine, confirmed as working for Windows 7 and Windows 8
 - Note: Negative dollar values may be displayed when using the grants ".csv" files. This is due to the test files containing dollar amounts that exceed the maximum value that an integer data type can hold. Since a C++ integer can hold a maximum value of $2^31 = $2.15 billion, and it is unexpected that anyone will receive a grant greater than $2.15 billion, this issue was left unaddressed.
